**digisec.directory** is a compilation of digital security and safety resources by the contributors of [EngageMedia Digital Security Localization project](https://engagemedia.org/projects/localization/). 

You can help improve this directory by adding new tools, guides, and contacts or by updating existing ones. There are two ways to contribute an update to the directory.

## N﻿o Rights Reserved

By updating the directory, you agree to making your contribution public domain as per [CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) Public Domain Dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

You may add attribution in the front matter parameter `credits` of the content files that you contribute. This attribution is only visible in the front matter of the content files and will not appear on the published website.

## Listing Considerations

The following dos and don'ts serve as a general rule.

1. DO flag tools that are

   * Freemium – this tool is available for free but additional storage, bandwidth, or features are available with a paid upgrade;
   * Premium – this tool is only available with a paid subscription; or
   * Closed Source – this tool does not have publicly available and verifiable source code.
2. DO NOT include free tools that are directly or indirectly supported or subsidised by an advertising-based business model.
3. DO NOT add new guides that have not been updated for more than five years. An exception can be made if the content has not gone out of date.
4. DO NOT list tools or guides created by big tech corporations (e.g. Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Apple, Meta/Facebook, and Microsoft).

## F﻿ork on GitLab

1. Go to [eml10n/digisecdirectory](https://gitlab.com/eml10n/digisecdirectory) repository on Gitlab.
2. Click on the [fork](https://gitlab.com/eml10n/digisecdirectory/-/forks/new) button and continue working on your preferred code editor. Alternatively, launch the Web IDE and continue working from within your web browser.
3. Browse the `content` directory and familiarise yourself with its contents before you edit or add any file.
4. Edit or add Markdown files in the `content` directory and commit your changes to your forked repository. 
5. When you are done with your update, create a new merge request by choosing the `eml10n/digisecdirectory` as the target repository and `main` as the target branch.
