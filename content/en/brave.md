Brave is a privacy-focused internet browser built off the open-source Chromium codebase. The Brave browser blocks invasive ads and cross-site trackers by default. Users also benefit from built-in functionalities for added security with automatic secure HTTP connections and Tor-based anonymous network routing. Brave is available in desktop, Android, and iOS versions.
