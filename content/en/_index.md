**digisec.directory** is a compilation of digital security and safety resources by the contributors of [EngageMedia Digital Security Localization project](https://engagemedia.org/projects/localization/). This directory primarily lists digital security and safety tools and guides, and resource groups that are available in Burmese, Filipino, Indonesian, Khmer, Thai, and English.

In this directory, we group the [digital security tools](/categories/digital-security-tools/) by their main utility or function, namely

As much as possible, we include free and open-source tools, ie you have the freedom to use, modify, and redistribute the source code without any restriction. 

Some tools in this directory are tagged as:

W﻿e also flag certain tools as:

* Freemium – this tool is available for free but additional storage, bandwidth, or other features are available with a paid upgrade; and
* Closed Source – this tool does not have publicly available and verifiable source code.

S﻿ome tools are grouped into special categories like:

The [digital security guides](/categories/digital-security-guides/) section contains a list of resources including step-by-step instructions, user manuals, trainer's handbooks, support toolkits, and other similar materials. These guides cover a wide range of digital security and safety topics including privacy, surveillance, censorship, encryption, backup, and more.

In the [digital security network](/categories/digital-security-network/) section of this directory, we list organisations that support human rights defenders by providing digital security [training](/categories/digital-security-trainers/) and [crisis response](/categories/digital-security-crisis-responders/).
