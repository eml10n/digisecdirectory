Data Detox x Youth is an activity book to help young people take control of their tech. This interactive toolkit encourages young people to think about different aspects of their digital lives, from their social media profiles to their passwords, with simple activities for reflection and play.

The activity book contains four sections:

* Digital Privacy, which focuses on reducing data traces and understanding online profiling;
* Digital Security, with tips on creating strong and secure passwords;
* Digital Wellbeing, which deals with the addictive nature of smartphones;
* and finally Misinformation, a guide for consuming and sharing information online.
